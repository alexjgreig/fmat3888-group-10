## Strategic Rationale (Aligned with notes.md)

### Macro View
- Late-cycle, liquidity-rich expansion favors equities over duration
- AI/datacenter capex drives global equity outperformance
- Fiscal-driven curve steepening reduces domestic bond appeal

### Implementation
- **International tilt**: Increased allocation to unhedged international equity captures global growth
- **Infrastructure overweight**: Provides inflation protection in rising rate environment
- **Cash buffer**: Maintains operational liquidity for 1% p.a. fund outflows
- **Reduced property**: Avoids doubling up on Australian housing exposure

### Risk Management
- **Tracking error constraint**: Ensures portfolio doesn't deviate excessively from peers
- **Active weight limits**: Maximum 5% deviation from benchmark for any single asset
- **Volatility reduction**: 84 bps lower volatility than benchmark improves risk-adjusted returns

## Transaction Cost Analysis

### One-off Implementation
- Estimated reallocation cost: 7 basis points (0.07%)
- Based on 0.25% cost per asset reallocation

### Ongoing Costs
- Management expense ratio increase: 1.7 bps
- Tax drag increase: 13 bps (offset by growth asset tax efficiency)

## Conclusion

The optimized portfolio successfully achieves:
1. **Risk reduction**: Lower volatility while maintaining competitive returns
2. **Benchmark alignment**: Limited tracking error ensures mandate retention
3. **Strategic positioning**: Aligned with late-cycle macro view
4. **Cost efficiency**: Minimal implementation and ongoing costs
