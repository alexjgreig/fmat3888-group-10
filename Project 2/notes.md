CPI (2.594%) is derived from a blended average of market-implied inflation-linked swaps (2.688%) and the RBA target inflation band midpoint (2.5%), grounding our guidance on market forecasts and mechanical monetary policy intervention. Growth asset exposure (73%) remains within the Balanced optionâ€™s 60-76% allowable IGF range, aligning Abercrombie with the Medium-High investment risk peer-average of 72.58%. The new portfolio exceeds 50% investment objective threshold with 64.21%/15.07% prob. of objective/negative year, while maintaining appropriate risk for the Medium-High band (3.00-3.99) with SRM of 3.01. Although portfolio volatility rises from 8.12% to 8.37%, the diversification ratio improves from 1.258 to 1.279, reflecting enhanced cross-market return stability and reduced concentration risk. A +2% growth asset allocation lies within regular rebalancing tolerance bands (2.4% S.D across Balanced funds, YoY), ensuring the transition remains turnover-efficient and effectively transaction-cost neutral. At a 0.25% reallocation cost per asset, this equates to an estimated one-off implementation cost of 7bps. The management expense ratio increases by 1.7bps due to higher international and hedged exposure, while portfolio tax drag rises 13bps, as reduced domestic equity exposure (0% tax-rate) is offset by the rise in growth assets, taxed 1% less than defensives. 

Justification Macro: We view the next 3-10 years as a late-cycle, liquidity-rich expansion. US policy is increasingly pro-cyclical, supporting resilient growth as core inflation persists. Yield curves continue to steepen under compounding fiscal risks such as persistent deficits, significant issuance and sticky inflation, while AI/datacentre capex and energy infrastructure demands keep nominal GDP elevated. These conditions favor equities over long-duration: carry is positive, but the convexity benefit is limited, while credit spreads are at their tightest levels since the late-1990s. Against this backdrop we rebalance away from the Australian domestic bias in growth and defensive assets toward broader global earnings and diversified rates. Growth: We trim Australian equities by 5% (to 25%) to reduce commodity/housing cyclicality and single-sovereign risk while retaining franked income. International equities are lifted to 38%, capturing secular global earnings (primarily in AI, with the Mag-7 now 19.9% of ACWI ex-AU). As 77% of members are under 55, indicating moderate tolerance for FX variability, but peers hedge only 26.7% of international equity exposure on average (APRA Quarterly MySuper, 2025), we raise our hedge ratio modestly from 30.5% to 34.2% to reflect a softer USD outlook against AUD without over-dampening diversification. As global easing broadens equity market leadership beyond mega-cap exposure, we introduce 4% International small caps for cyclicality but retain 0% Australian small caps given their high correlation to our existing domestic equity exposure (93.26%) and greater volatility (16.76% vs 13.82% for S&P/ASX300). We nudge A-REITs to 6% (+1%) to capture inflation-participating cash flows as financing conditions improve with lower front-end rates. EM equities (0%) are excluded as inherent policy and FX risks are already embedded within our international equity holdings (22 DM and 24 EM in ACWI ex-AU), and therefore EM exposure offers no clear SAA-level compensation while carrying a large holding cost (0.25% p.a. vs 0.10% p.a. for unhedged ACWI ex-AU). Defensive: With fiscal-driven curve steepening, domestic bonds provide less diversification per unit duration. Accordingly, we reduce Australian fixed income to 16% (-6%) and add 7% international fixed income (AUD-hedged) to diversify sovereign/funding profiles and access global term premia without FX noise. As rate cuts lower cash yields and credit spreads stay tight, excess cash is expected to lag, so we lower cash to 4% while preserving operational liquidity to service 1% p.a. fund outflows. Overall, we remain pro-risk but more globally diversified, reducing over-reliance on domestic beta and duration while aligning our hedging and liquidity discipline with our member demographics and YFYS competitiveness.
