## üìä Key Results Presented

### Portfolio Metrics
- **Benchmark Portfolio**: 8.64% return, 8.20% volatility, 0.809 Sharpe
- **Optimized Portfolio**: 8.34% return, 7.36% volatility, 0.862 Sharpe
- **Tracking Error**: 1.31% (well within 2% constraint)
- **VaR (95%)**: 3.83% (improved from 4.86% benchmark)

### Asset Allocation
| Asset Class | Benchmark | Optimized | Active Position |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Australian Equity | 25% | 20% | -5% |
| Int'l Equity (Unhedged) | 25% | 30% | +5% |
| Int'l Infrastructure | 2% | 7% | +5% |
| Cash | 4% | 9% | +5% |

### Strategic Insights
- Maintains close alignment with industry benchmarks (low tracking error)
- Improves Sharpe ratio while reducing volatility
- Aligns with late-cycle macro view from notes.md
- Implementation cost of 7 basis points
